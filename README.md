# GifHub Chrome Extension

Markdown-friendly gifs for all.

## What is this?

Sometimes you want to throw a gif in GitHub, but it's a pain to have to go to Giphy, find the right image, and then write the Markdown needed
to inject sweet gif/dank meme into your PR/Issue/Whatever.  This extension does all the heavy lifting and allows you to search for gifs.  With a 
simple click, you have the necessary markdown in your clipboard to litter your GitHub with bloated images for lulz!

## How to Use

* Clone this repo.
* `npm install`
* `npm build`
* Browse over to `chrome://extensions` in omnibar
* Click "Load Unpacked"
