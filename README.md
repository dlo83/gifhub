## What is this?

Sometimes you want to throw a gif in GitHub, but it's a pain to have to go to Giphy, find the right image, and then write the Markdown needed
to inject a sweet gif/dank meme into your PR/Issue/Whatever.  This extension does all the heavy lifting and allows you to search for gifs.  With a 
simple click, you have the necessary markdown in your clipboard to litter your GitHub with bloated images for lulz!
